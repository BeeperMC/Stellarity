# Stellarity

**Stellarity** *(previously known as `FokaStudio's Ender Expansion`)* is a Minecraft 1.20.1 datapack which focuses on rehauling The End dimension in a new, unique and a fairly lively way, following a distinct lore.

Stellarity started off as a direct port of [Far End](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/far-end-ender-expansion-datapack-v0-1/), for a server called Azalea Network, but grew into its own independent project as time passed.

Needless to say, **the pack is now nothing like its predecessor**. Everything has changed drastically, with more changes to the original being made each day.
