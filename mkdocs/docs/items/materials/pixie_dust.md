**Pixie** is a post-Dragon crafting material dropped by [Pixies](../../mobs/pixie.md). It is used to craft multiple new weapons. Its secondary use is summoning the [Empress of Light](../../mobs/bosses/empress_of_light.md) when offered as a sacrifice at the [Chapel of Light](../../structures/chapel_of_light.md).
