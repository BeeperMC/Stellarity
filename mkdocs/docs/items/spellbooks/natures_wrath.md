**Book of Light** is a post-Dragon spellbook which can either shoot a homing Nature's Spirit with limited range when right clicked or summon a pack of Spirit Wolves when used while sneaking. Both abilities can be upgraded by visiting certain biomes while holding the book.

## Obtaining
Librarians in [End Villages](../structures/end_village.md) can turn any Enchanted Book into Nature's Wrath for 12 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-emerald"></i>Oak Saplings. However, only half of them sell the Spellbook.

## Usage
Right-clicking creates a healing aura with a radius of 5.5 blocks. Any player who steps inside will get Regeneration II and Resistance I. They will also be cured from Weakness and Slowness debuffs.

Aura lasts for 17 seconds. There is a 48 second cooldown between creating different auras.

## Tips 
- This is a neat ranged weapon which on top of plethora of special effects it provides has unlimited ammo.
- Damage of Spirits cannot be boosted by any means, other than Nature's Wrath self-upgrading.

## Trivia
- Even though the description says it has a 48 second cooldown, it starts right when an aura is created, meaning the actual cooldown is 31 seconds instead.
