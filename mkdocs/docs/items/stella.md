## Obtaining
After defeating the Ender Dragon for the first time, the Dragonblade will spawn stuck in the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed). It can be picked up by anyone with right-click.

Only one Dragonblade generates on each world, making it the rarest item in the entire datapack.

## Usage
Hitting enemies inflicts *'Dragon Stacks'*. The amount of Stacks an enemy has at the given moment is represented by a purple sphere above their head - brighter color is equal to more stacks. After hitting a mob 3 times, a player can sneak to trigger a powerful punch. Stacks are reset after 16 seconds have passed without either a punch or another attack.

Punching warps affected entity by 6.6 blocks away from the player. Mobs can't be warped through blocks, stopping in front of them instead. Punch deals 7:heart: х ₃.₅ of base damage. This damage ignores 40% of enemy armor, meaning that higher defense and enchantments will not reduce the damage as much as they would regularly do.

Punched enemies will also have Weakness I applied to them for 7 seconds, on top of being stunned for 1 second. Stuns make mobs completely unable to move. Immobilization doesn't prevent jumping and fall damage.

If an enemy is punched into blocks, the damage is boosted to 24:heart: x ₁₂. The duration of Weakness is boosted to 11 seconds and punched mobs are stunned for 2 seconds. Other enemies will take 4:heart::heart: splash damage, while also being afflicted with Weakness I for 3 seconds.

Each level of **Knockback enchantment** enchances punch distance by 1.1 blocks while also increasing the damage. The increase per level is +1.5, +4 and +1.5 for regular, wall and splash type damage respectively.

Punched mobs cannot have stacks applied to them for the next 8 seconds, indicated by a cloud of dust above their head.

Punches deal explosion damage, meaning that **Blast Protection enchantment** is going to be more efficient at blocking it.

## Tips
- This weapon is great for hitting and running. Just make sure to reapply Prismatic Inferno every few seconds for it to not timeout.
