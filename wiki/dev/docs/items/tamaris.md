## Obtaining
Tamaris has a 33% chance to be dropped by the Ender Dragon.

## Usage
When damaged below 35% of health, mobs will have a white mark above their head. This means they are 'executable'. 

After sneaking for a moment, you will warp to the nearest 'executable' mob, instantly killing them. This has a 1 second cooldown, indicated by red `DISABLED` text in your action bar.

Canceling Execute ability mid-way will result in a 5 seconds cooldown being applied. Executing a mob holding a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-totem-of-undying"></i>Totem of Undying will apply a 11 second cooldown in order to prevent saved mob from being executed a second after using a Totem.

## Tips
- You can use it as a secondary weapon among your weapon of choice. Just switch to it once you think enemy is low enough to be executed.
- The execute treshold is lower for certain mobs.
    - In PvP, health percentage required to mark a player 'executable' is **25%**.
    - On bosses *(Wither, Empress of Light)* and Wardens, this treshold is **15%**.
    - Non mob-entities *(Item Frames, Armor Stands)* and the Ender Dragon are immune to the Execute move.

## Trivia
- The way how execute ability works is that it deals 999 damage with 100% armor penetration, instead of directly doing `/kill`.
    - This is because `/kill` ignores <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-totem-of-undying"></i>Totems of Undying.
- This item was supposed to be called `Void Star`, but the official name was changed before release.
- This item and its ability is based on Hannah[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - Sounds used for triggering the Execute ability are actual sounds of Hannah triggering her Execute move from Roblox Bedwars.
        - Additionally, FokaStudio uses a different execute sound, being the one of Victorious Hannah kit skin.
- Tamaris was supposed to replace Dragonblade as its one-per-world kind of item.
    - However due to a community vote, it became a Dragon drop instead.
- Its name `Tamaris` is a reference to FokaStudio's grandma's cat's name - *Tamara*.
    - The name *Tamara* is polish name derivating from hebrew. It rougly translates into `palm tree`.
    - FokaStudio chose to base the name off the aformentioned cat because he had always seen the pet as a `hidden assasin who is ready to scratch everyone to death`.
        - To make things funnier, the cat is not hostile at all, and loves hugs.
- The advancement name `Kill la Kill` is a reference to a popular anime with the same name.
    - It means `Kill the prey` in French.
- Dying to the Execute ability in PvP will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM was publicly executed by PLAYER`.
