## Obtaining
Tamaris has a 66% chance to be dropped by the Ender Dragon. It always drops with either an [Ender Insignia](trinkets/ender_insignia.md) or [Crest of The End](trinkets/crest_of_the_end.md).

## Usage
When damaged below 25% of health, mobs will have a white mark above their head. This marks them weak. 

After sneaking for a moment, you will warp to the nearest weak mob, instantly killing them. This warp has a range of 16 blocks and will be cancelled if a mob walks out of that radius.

Executing a mob holding a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-totem-of-undying"></i>Totem of Undying will apply a 11 second cooldown in order to prevent saved mob from being executed a second after using a Totem. Cooldown is indicated by a <span style="color: red;">DISABLED</span> text in player's action bar.

### Dark Decay
Regular attacks inflict **Dark Decay** for 6 seconds. Dark Decay deals 3:heart: х ₁.₅ damage every 2 seconds for a total of 9:heart: х ₄.₅. It also has 20% armor penetration.

This damage over time effect stacks with likes of Wither, Poison or Fire.

Enchanting Tamaris with Curse of Vanishing upgrades Dark Decay to Dark Decay II, increasing its duration by 1 second and damage by 1:heart: х ₀.₅ for a total of 16:heart: х ₈ damage.

## Tips
- You can use it as a secondary weapon among your weapon of choice. Just switch to it once you think enemy is low enough to be executed.
- Tamaris prioritizes nearest weak mob while choosing a target to execute next. Keep in mind while trying to chain execute a group of weak mobs.
- The execute treshold is lower for certain mobs.
    - In PvP, health percentage required to mark a player 'executable' is **20%**.
    - On bosses *(Wither, Empress of Light)* and Wardens, this treshold is **15%**.
        - This means that: 
            - The Wither can be executed while below 45:heart: x ₂₂․₅ health.
            - The Empress of Light can be executed while below 120:heart: x ₆₀ health.
                - This is a major help during the fight due to Empress' high defense and damage reduction.
            - Warden can be executed while below 75:heart: x ₃₇․₅ health.
        - This does not apply to modded bosses or bosses from other datapacks, following 25% treshold instead. 
    - Non-living entities *(Item Frames, Armor Stands, etc.)* and the Ender Dragon are immune to Tamaris' execute.
- Try not to use this weapon in Multiplayer while teaming up with other players, as it could potentialy lead to one of your allies being accidentaly executed.

## Trivia
- The way how execute ability works is that it deals 999 damage with 100% armor penetration, instead of directly doing `/kill`.
    - This is because `/kill` ignores <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-totem-of-undying"></i>Totems of Undying.
- This item was supposed to be called `Void Star`, but the official name was changed before release.
    - It was also supposed to have a [consecrated](../mechanics/consecration.md) variant called `Hallow Star`, which would simply have different visual and sound effects.
- This item and its ability is based on Hannah[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - Sounds used for triggering the Execute ability are actual sounds of Hannah triggering her Execute move from Roblox Bedwars.
        - Additionally, FokaStudio uses a different execute sound, being the one of Victorious Hannah kit skin.
- Tamaris was supposed to replace Dragonblade as its one-per-world kind of item.
    - However due to a community vote, it became a Dragon drop instead.
- Its name `Tamaris` is a reference to FokaStudio's grandma's cat's name - *Tamara*.
    - The name *Tamara* is a polish name derivating from hebrew. It rougly translates into `palm tree`.
    - FokaStudio chose to base the name off the aformentioned cat because he had always seen the pet as a `hidden assasin who is ready to scratch to death absolutely everyone`.
        - To make things funnier, the cat is not hostile at all, and loves hugs.
- The advancement name `Kill la Kill` is a reference to a popular anime with the same name.
    - It means `Kill the prey` in French.
- Dying to the Execute ability in PvP will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM was publicly executed by PLAYER`.
