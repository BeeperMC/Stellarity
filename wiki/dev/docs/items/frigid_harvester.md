## Obtaining
Frigid Harvester has a 10% chance to be found inside Frozen Crates fished up from [Void Fishing](../mechanics/void_fishing.md).

Additionaly, <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-mob-stray-face"></i>Strays spawning in [Frosted Hills](../biomes/frosted_hills.md) have a 3% chance to spawn holding a Frigid Harvester. Killing them will cause them to drop the weapon. Strays equipped with Harvesters have increased health, defense and damage, and wear a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-helmet"></i>Diamond Helmet.

## Usage
Killing any living mob permanently increases Frigid Harvester's damage. The extra damage is listed in the item description.

Stronger mobs give more extra damage, while passive mobs barely give any.

Frigid Harvester goes through a few texture changes as it hits different amounts of extra damage. First being at +3, then at +6 and final one at +9. Extra damage isn't capped, however damage gains roll off quickly at higher amounts. If extra damage drops to 0 or 0.01, nothing is going to happen on kill. 

While holding Frigid Harvester in main hand movement speed is reduced by 15%.

### Passive Abilities

- **Chill** - **unlocked at +3 damage**; 20% chance per hit to apply Slowness I for 3 seconds to hit mob.
- **Frostburn** - **unlocked at +6 damage**; 25% chance per hit to apply Frostburn, dealing 2:heart:[^3] damage every second for 4 seconds.
- **Chill II** - **unlocked at +9 damage**; chance per hit increased to 33%, duration increased to 4 seconds and now also inflicts Weakness I.
- **Frostburn II** - **unlocked at +9 damage**; chance per hit increased to 50%, duration increased to 8 seconds.

## Tips
- It is relatively easy to get Frigid Harvester to +3 or +4 damage. It can be achieved in one night by just running around and killing Zombies or Skeletons.
- Getting Frigid Harvester to +9 might be difficult, as weaker mobs quickly stop giving extra damage.
    - Going past +9 requires grinding <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-mob-wither-face"></i>Withers or <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-mob-warden-face"></i>Wardens.
- Even though Frigid Harvester starts extremely weak compared to other late-game weapons, it can quickly outdamage them with right setup.
- You get slowed down while holding a Frigid Harvester. This can be cancelled out by using Swiftness Potion.
- Warden or Wither farming is an efficient to quickly level up a Frigid Harvester to even +10 or +11.

## Trivia
- This is the third Developer weapon to get added into Stellarity, the first being [Prismatic Punch](prismatic_punch.md), second being [Spirit Dagger](spirit_dagger.md).
- This weapon is based on Aery[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
	- In some places in the code, Frigid Harvester is reffered to as `aery_sword`.
- Lorewise, Frigid Harvester is said to have been made out of Enchanted Ice by an uknown Illager.
