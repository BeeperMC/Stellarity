## Obtaining
Frigid Harvester has a 10% chance to be found inside Frozen Crates fished up from [Void Fishing](../mechanics/void_fishing.md).

Additionaly, Strays spawning in [Frosted Hills](../biomes/frosted_hills.md) have a 3% chance to spawn holding a Frigid Harvester. Killing them will cause them to drop the weapon. Strays equipped with Harvesters have increased health, defense and damage, and wear a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-helmet"></i>Diamond Helmet.

## Usage
Killing any living mob permanently increases Frigid Harvester's damage. The extra damage is listed in the item description.

Stronger mobs give more extra damage, while passive mobs barely give any.

### Damage fall off
The extra damage calculation formula is `Y / [mod(Y, 100)]`

## Tips
- Spirits can be attracted by ANY damage, including *(but not limited to)* other Swords, Crossbows, Bows, etc., for as long as you are holding a Spirit Dagger in any hand.
    - However, the damage dealt has to be higher than 3:heart: х ₁.₅. Anything lower will simply not work.
- Teleporting has a distance limit of <u><b>70 blocks</b></u>, meaning that you could potentialy attract a Spirit by shooting an enemy with a Bow and teleport a great range.
    - Spyglass comes in handy in this scenario, since you can easily position your cursor on a Spirit and then switch to a Spirit Dagger in order to consume it.
- To fully use this weapon you have to obtain 2 of them. Using a weapon enchanted with Looting III is heavily encouraged due to how uncommon Phantoms are in The End.
    - Despite the drop chance being relatively low, this item can be easily obtained in great quantities by opening multiple [Pandora's Barrels](other/pandoras_barrel.md). Be careful though, as Pandora's Barrel also increases stats of spawned mobs.
- Slash attack won't deal any knockback, so you might still get damaged by mobs after teleporting.
    - Luckily, the 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: Absorption should be enough to tank at least part of the contact damage.
    - This can be remedied by enchanting your Spirit Daggers with Knockback.
- This item pairs extremely well with [Sharanga](sharanga.md), since Arrows shot from are unaffected by gravity, meaning that it is easier to snipe targets from far away in order to potentially attract Spirits.

## Trivia
- This is the second Developer weapon to get added into FSEE, the first being [Prismatic Punch](prismatic_punch.md).
- This weapon is based on Spirit Daggers - a weapon used by Evelynn[^1] in Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - This is also a reference to the fact that FokaStudio loves this game and plays it far more often than he is coding.
- This item had a total of 3 different drop chances prior to official release.
    - It first started with 12.5% base chance with 2.5% Looting bonus, then 15%/+3.5% before being nerfed to 10%/+1%, which stayed to this date.
- Prior to official release of 1.6a, Spirits used to directly heal 4:heart::heart: HP instead of granting 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: Absorption like it does now. This change was made to further replicate how Evelynn kit works in Roblox Bedwars.
- Spirit Dagger holds the title of the most tweaked weapon before its official release in a stable version, having been tweaked countless times prior to its release in 1.6a.
    - Some of the changes haven't even been listed on changelog Discord channel.
- In a development log made on January 27th 2023, Spirits were said have a light blue glowing outline, however this wasn't actually implemented.
- In PvP, dying to AoE slash attack will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM had their spirit consumed by PLAYER`.
