## Obtaining
Spirit Dagger has a 12.5% chance to drop from Phantoms **found anywhere in The End**. It won't drop in any other dimension to matter the circumstances. Looting enchantment increases the drop chance by 2.5% per level, for a max of 20% drop chance with Looting III. Don't be fooled by the 1/5 drop chance, as Phantoms spawn very rarely in The End, and only in a few biomes. 

## Usage
<div class="result" markdown>
<figure class="foka-side-image--right" markdown>
  ![Spirit](../assets/items/spirit_dagger/spirit.png){ align=right width="200vw" .border }

Spirit Dagger is pretty unique in terms of usage. When using only one, damaging enemies has a 33% to attract Spirits, but you won't be able to use them for anything unless you are holding 2 Spirit Daggers - one in your main hand, and one in your offhand.

Having both equipped will allow you to consume said Spirits by focusing on them for 7 ticks. Your consumption progress will be shown in your action bar.

Consuming Spirits will instantly teleport you to its location. Teleportation will create a large area slash that will damage all enemies around you for 7:heart: x 3.5 damage that fully bypasses all defense. This effect has lesser impact in PvP, only dealing 4:heart::heart: damage *(again, ignoring all armor)* to other players. After teleporting you will also receive *Strength I* and *Speed II* for 3 seconds, and you will also be slighly healed by 4:heart::heart:.

Attacked mobs that __attracted a Spirit__ won't be able to do it for 20 seconds, indicated by colorful particles above them.

## Tips
- Spirits are attracted by ANY damage, including *(but not limited to)* other Swords, Crossbows, Bows, etc., for as long as you are holding at least one Spirit Dagger.
    - Teleporting has a distance limit of <u><b>70 blocks</b></u>, meaning that you could potentialy attract a Spirit by shooting an enemy with a Bow and teleport a great range.
- To fully use this weapon you have to obtain 2 of them. Using a weapon enchanted with Looting III is heavily encouraged due to how uncommon Phantoms are in The End.
- Endermen are immune to AoE slash attack, simply teleporting away whenever a player is about to land one.
- Slash attack will deal small amount of knockback to all nearby enemies, but if you were to teleport too close to them, they could still hit you. Fortunately, with a good armor set, the 4:heart::heart: HP heal will be more than enough to tank the damage.
- This item pairs extremely well with [Sharanga](sharanga.md), since Arrows shot from are unaffected by gravity, meaning that it is easier to snipe targets from far away in order to potentially attract Spirits.

## Trivia
- This is the second Developer weapon to get added into FSEE, the first being [Prismatic Punch](prismatic_punch.md).
- This weapon is based on Spirit Daggers - a weapon used by Evelynn[^1] in Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - This is also a reference to the fact that FokaStudio loves this game and plays it far more often than he is coding.
        - Despite the weapon's ability being based on Evelynn[^1] kit, he prefers Hannah[^3] kit. To make matter even funnier, he doesn't even have Evelynn, but he has Hannah.
