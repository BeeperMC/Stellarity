## Obtaining
Spirit Dagger has a 10% chance to drop from Phantoms **found anywhere in The End**. It won't drop in any other dimension. Looting enchantment increases the drop chance by 1% per level, for a maximum of 13% drop chance with Looting III.

Spirit Dagger also has a <u>very low</u> chance to drop from Endermen **found anywhere in The End** as well, having a 1% base drop chance that is increased by 1% with every level of Looting, for a maximum drop chance of 4%.

## Usage
<div class="result" markdown>
<figure class="foka-side-image--right" markdown>
  ![Spirit](../assets/items/spirit_dagger/spirit.png){ align=right width="200vw" .border }
  <figcaption>Attracted Spirit</figcaption>
</figure>

Spirit Dagger is pretty unique in terms of usage. When using only one, damaging enemies has a 50% chance to attract Spirits, but you won't be able to use them for anything unless you are holding 2 Spirit Daggers - one in your main hand, and one in your offhand. There can exist only one Spirit in a 6 block radius.
</div>

Having both equipped will allow you to consume said Spirits by focusing on them for 7 ticks. Your consumption progress will be shown in your action bar.

Consuming Spirits will instantly teleport you to their location. Teleportation will create a large area slash that will damage all enemies around you for 4:heart::heart: damage with 50% armor penetration. After that you will receive a small combat buff in form of 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: points of temporar Absorption, extra 4.5:heart: х ₂.₂₅ damage, 40% extra movement speed and 10% extra attack speed. All these buffs last for 5 seconds.

Attacked mobs that __have attracted a Spirit__ won't be able to do it again for the next 17 seconds, indicated by colorful particles above their head.

## Tips
- Spirits can be attracted by ANY damage, including *(but not limited to)* other Swords, Crossbows, Bows, etc., for as long as you are holding a Spirit Dagger in any hand. a 
    - However, the damage dealt has to be higher than 3:heart: х ₁.₅. Anything lower than that will simply not work.
- Teleporting has a distance limit of <u><b>70 blocks</b></u>, meaning that you could potentialy attract a Spirit by shooting an enemy with a Bow and teleport a great range.
    - Spyglass comes in handy in this scenario, since you can easily position your cursor on a Spirit and then switch to a Spirit Dagger in order to consume it.
- To fully use this weapon you have to obtain 2 of them. Using a weapon enchanted with Looting III is heavily encouraged due to how uncommon Phantoms are in The End.
    - Despite the drop chance being relatively low, this item can be easily obtained in great quantities by opening multiple [Pandora's Barrels](other/pandoras_barrel.md). Be careful though, as Pandora's Barrel also increases stats of spawned mobs.
- Slash attack won't deal any knockback, so you might still get damaged by mobs after teleporting.
    - Luckily, the 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: Absorption should be enough to tank at least part of the contact damage.
- This item pairs extremely well with [Sharanga](sharanga.md), since Arrows shot from are unaffected by gravity, meaning that it is easier to snipe targets from far away in order to potentially attract Spirits.

## Trivia
- This is the second Developer weapon to get added into FSEE, the first being [Prismatic Punch](prismatic_punch.md).
- This weapon is based on Spirit Daggers - a weapon used by Evelynn[^1] in Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - This is also a reference to the fact that FokaStudio loves this game and plays it far more often than he is coding.
- This item had a total of 3 different drop chances prior to official release.
    - It first started with 12.5% base chance with 2.5% Looting bonus, then 15%/+3.5% before being nerfed to 10%/+1%, which stayed to this date.
- Prior to official release of 1.6a, Spirits used to directly heal 4:heart::heart: HP instead of granting 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: Absorption like it does now. This change was made to further replicate how Evelynn kit works in Roblox Bedwars.
- Spirit Dagger holds the title of the most tweaked weapon before its official release in a stable version, having countless tweakes being made to it before releasing 1.6a.
    - Some of them haven't even been listed on changelog Discord channel.
- In a development log made on January 27th 2023, Spirits were said have a light blue glowing outline, however this isn't actually implemented.
- In PvP, dying to AoE slash attack will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM had their spirit consumed by PLAYER`.
