## Obtaining
Clockwork Crossbow has a chance to drop from Pillagers in [Strongholds](../structures/stronghold.md) with a 7% base chance. Each level of Looting increases the odds by 2%, up to a total of 13% with Looting III.

## Usage
Holding Clockwork Crossbow in your hands will automatically load it, provided you have at least 1 Arrow in your inventory. Arrows will be stripped of its special properties (e.g. Spectral Arrows -> Arrows). 

There is a 33% chance to not consume any ammo upon loading. Quick Charge enchantment reduces the chance even futher by 7%, with Quick Charge III giving a 54% chance to save Arrows.

Arrows shot by this weapon deal reduced damage compared to regular Crossbows, ranging from 4:heart::heart: - 7:heart: x 3.5 with an average of 5:heart: x2.5 damage per shot.

## Tips
- All arrow types will be converted into regular Arrows, so save your stronger ammunition for use with other weapons.
- It's low damage is compensated with an incredible attack speed, so DPS is even better than the one of a regular Crossbow.
- This weapons can drain you of any Arrows really quickly! Make sure to enchant it with Quick Charge as soon as you can,
- Due to how invincibilty frames work in Minecraft, some Arrows will bounce of enemies without dealing any damage, losing their damage potential in the process.
    - Therefore, Piercing enchantment is better for general usage with Clockwork Crossbow, with Multishot being better for events like Raids or as a second chance to hit an enemy if your accuracy isn't the best.
    - This is not an issue on Project: SMP, due to all projectiles inflicting no invulnerability frames at all.

## Trivia
- This is the second ranged weapon to ever be added into FSEE, with first one being the [Sharanga](sharanga.md).
- The tooltip is a reference to [tumblr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:tumblr )'s old terms of service `"Go nuts. Show nuts. Whatever."`
- There are several unused textures for loading animation of Clockwork Crossbow, and one where it is loaded with a Firework instead of an Arrow.
