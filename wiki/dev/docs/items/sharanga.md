## Obtaining
Sharanga has a chance to drop from Illusioners in [Strongholds](../structures/stronghold.md)) with a 9% base chance. Each level of Looting increases the odds by 3%, up to a total of 18% with Looting III. It drops with 7 - 22 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows.

## Usage
Unless <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows are used as ammunition for this Bow, it has no special properties other than reduced durability.

When firing <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows, they are converted into high velocity Spectral Bolts. Spectral Bolts can pierce an infinite number of enemies, inflicting Glowing for 10 seconds, while moving at 1.25x the velocity of standard Arrows. This also means their damage is increased by 25% too due to how arrow damage is calculated. Spectral Bolts have no gravity.

Spectral Bolts also explode after hitting a block, or after 2 seconds of flying. The explosion deals 66% of base arrow damage with 15% armor penetration. It does not increase with pull time. Explosions also inflict Glowing for 10 seconds, just like Bolts themselves.

| Power | Damage |
| :--- | :--- |
| :x: | 1 (:heart: х ₁ ⁄₂) |
| 1 | 2 (:heart:) |
| 2 | ~3 (:heart: х ₁.₅) |
| 3 | ~3 (:heart: х ₁.₅) |
| 4 | 3 (:heart: х ₁.₅) |
| 5 | 4 (:heart::heart:) |

## Tips
- Because of how rounding works, Spectral Bolt explosions deals between 2.3 - 2.7 damage for Power levels 2 and 3, and not full 3.
- The armor-ignoring properties of Spectral Explosion do not work in PvP.
- This bow can deal up to 21 damage with Power V. This is balanced with its shorter range.
- Arrows will always disappear after 1.5 seconds, not after travelling a set distance.
- Sharanga has reduced durability compared to regular bows, so enchant it with Unbreaking (and/or Mending) as soon as possible to use it for as long as possible!

## Trivia
- This is the first ranged weapon to ever be added into FSEE.
- Prior to 1.6a, Explosions would respect armor and deal set 10 damage to all enemies. This has been changed since then.
- Endermen don't teleport when hit with Spectral Explosion, but will if hit with Spectral Bolts. 
- In PvP, dying to a Spectral Bolt explosion will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM was torn apart by PLAYER's Spectral Boom`.
