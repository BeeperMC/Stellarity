## Obtaining
Sharanga has a chance to drop from Illusioners in [Strongholds](../structures/stronghold.md) with a 9% base chance. Each level of Looting increases the odds by 3%, up to a total of 18% with Looting III. It drops with 7 - 22 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows.

## Usage
Unless <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows are used as ammunition for this Bow, it has no special properties other than increased durability.

When using <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows as ammunition, they are converted into high velocity Spectral Bolts. Spectral Bolts can pierce an infinite number of enemies, inflicting Glowing for 10 seconds, while moving at 1.25x the speed of standard Arrows. This also means their damage is increased by 25% too due to how arrow damage is calculated in Minecraft. Spectral Bolts have don't fall off with gravity, travelling in a perfectly straight line.

Spectral Bolts also explode after hitting a block, or after 1.5 seconds of flying. The explosion deals 66% of base arrow damage with 15% armor penetration. It does not increase or decrease with draw time. Just like the Bolts, explosions inflicting Glowing for 10 seconds.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows have a 33% chance to not be used after being fired. This chance doubles with Infinity enchantment for a 66% chance to not be consumed.

### Explosion Damage

| Power Enchantment Level | Damage |
| :--- | :--- |
| :x: | 1 (:heart: х ₁ ⁄₂) |
| 1 | 2 (:heart:) |
| 2 | ~3 (:heart: х ₁.₅) |
| 3 | ~3 (:heart: х ₁.₅) |
| 4 | 3 (:heart: х ₁.₅) |
| 5 | 4 (:heart::heart:) |

## Tips
- Because of how rounding works, Spectral Bolt explosions deals between 2.3 - 2.7 damage for Power levels 2 and 3, and not full 3.
- Arrows will always disappear after 1.5 seconds, not after travelling a set distance.
- Sharanga enchanted with Infinity is superior to one enchanted with Mending due to increased chance of conserving <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows.
- Skeletons in The End drop <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows on death while being inflicted with Glowing, meaning that setting up a mob farm there could be a really good way to get the special ammunition for Sharanga.

## Trivia
- This is the first ranged weapon to ever be added into FSEE.
- Prior to 1.6a, explosions would respect armor and deal set 10 damage to all enemies. This has been changed since then.
- Endermen don't teleport when hit with Spectral Explosion, but will if hit with Spectral Bolts.
- In PvP, dying to a Spectral Bolt explosion will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM was torn apart by PLAYER's Spectral Boom`.
