## Obtaining
Prismatic Pearl is dropped by the Empress of Light.

## Usage
Prismatic Pearl works just the same way an Ender Pearl works, however after being thrown, it returns to the player after 6 seconds.

On top of that, it flies 25% faster, which translates into 25% greater teleport distance.

Prismatic Pearl leaves a rainbow trail as it flies.

## Tips 
- There is no minimum damage treshold required for stars to spawn.
    - This means that Starstruck Carcanet synergizes well with Shulker Armor due to provided tankiness and damage resistance.

## Trivia
- This item was made just so Bush would shut up.
    - Spoiler alert: it didn't work :pensive:.
