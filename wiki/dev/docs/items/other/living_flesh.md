## Obtaining
Chests in End Dungeons have a 23% chance to contain 1 - 8 Living Flesh.

## Usage
When consumed, players will get Regeneration VII for 3 seconds *(enough to restore 60:heart: x 30 HP)*, but will be weakened for 14 seconds. Players get 7 seconds off Weakness II *(-8:dagger:DMG)* and another 7 seconds off Weakness I *(-4:dagger:DMG)*

## Trivia

- [Ancient Armor](../armor/ancient_armor.md.md), [Hallowed Armor](../armor/hallowed_armor.md.md) and Living Flesh were the first items to have ever been added into FSEE.
    - The first ever items to be added are [Treasure Heads](../../mechanics/treasure_heads.md)
    - While it got added as far back as 1.3a, Living Flesh had no use before 1.5a.

## History
