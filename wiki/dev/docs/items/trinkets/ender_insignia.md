## Obtaining
Ender Insignia has a 50% chance to drop from the [Ender Dragon](../mobs/bosses/ender_dragon.md).

## Usage
While holding Ender Insignia in any hand, sneaking will slowly accelerate your Health Regeneration. This progresses through a level-like system, with levels *(and what comes with it - regeneration speed)* increases every 5 seconds.

| Time Sneaking *(in seconds)* | Health Regeneration Bonus |
| :--- | :--- |
| < 5s | :x: |
| 5s | 0.4:heart: × 0.2 | 
| 10s | 0.8:heart: × 0.4 |
| 15s | 1.67:heart: × 0.835 |
| 20s | 3.33:heart: × 1.665 |
| 25s | 6.67:heart: × 3.335 |
| 30s+ | 20:heart: × 10 |


## Tips
- Swift Sneak Enchantment pairs well with this item, since you can get a bit more mobility while keeping its regeneration bonus.
- Your movement speed will be reduced even further than normally while sneaking, and you will lose the ability to jump.

## Trivia

- Prior to 1.6a, it used to give a set Regeneration bonus anytime you are completely immobile.
- Prior to 1.6a, due to the way Regeneration was implemented, it would be constantly reapplied, slowing down health gain.

## History

- **1.6a**
	- Drop rate reduced in favor of other items (100% -> 50%)
	- Regeneration is no longer instantly at Level V, and it instead slowly goes through different stages with varying Regeneration bonuses.
	- Being hit now properly cancels Regeneration.
	- Regeneration now gets applied while sneaking, rather than standing still.
	- Fixed a bug that caused Regeneration to be constantly applied which was halting its healing.

- **1.5b**
    - Fixed a bug that caused Ender Insignia's give command to return a broken item instead.

- **1.5a**
	- Introduced
