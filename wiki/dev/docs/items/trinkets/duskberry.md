## Obtaining
Duskberries can be found in Ships in [End Cities](../structures/end_city.md), but only if they generate in [The Hallow](../biomes/the_hallow.md). They can be found in <u>non-treasure</u> Chest at an oddly specific 57.14% chance.

## Usage
<div class="result" markdown>
<figure class="foka-side-image--right" markdown>
  ![Planted Duskberry](../../assets/items/duskberry/planted.png){ align=right width="200vw" .border }
  <figcaption>Planted Duskberry</figcaption>
</figure>
While holding a Duskberry in your main hand or off hand, you get + 22% damage and +15% movement speed. You will also get permament Night Vision.
</div>

Eating one will curse the consumer, giving them Darkness, Slowness, Mining Fatigue, Weakness and Nausea for 5 minutes each. 

You can also plant them, which will curse any entity that passes through the bush, but it will give Blindness instead of Darkness.

Duskberries can also be fed to Foxes, which won't be cursed, but poisoned instead, leaving them extremely vulnerable at 1:heart: x 1/2 HP.

Doing all 3 of these things - eating, planting and feeding a Duskberry to a Fox - will give you the `Poor Life Choices` advancement. Just picking it up will instead give you the `Don't Bush Your Luck!` advancement.

## Tips

- Duskberries are extremely useful for getting `How Did We Get Here?` advancement due to sheer amount of debuffs it gives at once.
    - Also, Duskberries give Darkness when consumed, but Blindness when placed down.
        - This was done due to an in-game bug that caused Area Effect Cloud Darkness to not work properly.
- Harvesting Duskberries from planted bushes will not work, meaning that **planting Duskberries will permanently use them**.
    - This can be annyoing if you were to accidentaly right click while holding it, since it will plant your held Duskberry.
- Duskberries can also be found in [Hallowed Crates](../mechanics/void_fishing.md#crates), which is far easier than locating an End City in The Hallow.
- Duskberries are really versatile, fantastic both for combat *(due to a huge 22% damage increase)* as well as simple exploration *(due to 15% movement speed bonus)*. They are also perfect for caving because of permanent Night Vision.

- Duskberries are said to taste like Bizmuth.
- Duskberries are a special item dedicated to DuskAdler for being 666th member to join Foka's Studios Discord server.
- Their original color scheme used for this item was Dark Red, but Dusk didn't really like it, so it was changed to Otherwordly Purple instead.
- During development stage, Duskberry used to have a different texture than it has now. It looked like a berry far more than the current one.
