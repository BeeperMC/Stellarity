## Obtaining
Zephyr can be found in Top Tower Chests inside [End Cities](../structures/end_city.md) with a 14% chance.

## Usage
Holding Zephyr in main hand gives a passive 10% Movement Speed bonus.

Killing any mob with this shortsword spawns a small wind orb which quickly homes to the player. Once it comes into contact it grants Speed I for 33 seconds. The duration increases with each kill, capped at 4 minutes. The additional uptime decreases as current duration of Speed effect inceases. 

The ability speed increase stacks with passive speed increase for a total of 30% extra movement speed.

## Tips
- Setting up a mob farm can easily replace the need to craft Swiftness Potions.
	- Maximum duration of Zephyr's speed boost is even greater than the duration of an extended Swiftness Potion.
- Passive 10% boost doesn't work if Zephyr is held in the offhand.

## Trivia
- Zephyr has almost identical stats as a Diamond Sword, with the only difference being its lower durability, being a bit higher than an Iron Sword's.
- The word `zephyr` means a soft light breeze.

## History
- **1.6a**
