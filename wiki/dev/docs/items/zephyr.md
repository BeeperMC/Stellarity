## Obtaining
Zephyr can be obtained in 2 different ways:
- Crafitng by combining a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-golden-sword"></i>Golden Sword, <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-sword"></i>Iron Sword, 10 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-feather"></i>Feathers and 6 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-sugar"></i>Sugar over [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md). Enchantments from both swords will not be preserved and will be lost.
- Being found in Top Tower Chests inside [End Cities](../structures/end_city.md) with a 14% chance.

## Usage
Holding Zephyr in main hand will give you a passive 7.5% Movement Speed bonus.

Killing any mob using this dagger will spawn a small wind orb that will quickly home onto the player. Once it comes into contact it will grant 16 seconds of Speed I, which is equivalent to 20% speed increase. This stacks with Zephyr's passive speed increase for a grand total of 27.5% Movement Speed increase.

## Tips
- This sword proves useful against [Empress of Light](../mobs/bosses/empress_of_light.md). Setting up an arena next to a Monster Spawner or an animal farm makes you able to quickly slash a couple of mobs in order to get a speed increase that might be necessary to dodge some of the harder attacks.
    - This makes brewing Speed Potions extremely redundant.
        - Do keep in mind that this method is a lot cheaper, but it requires you to:
            1. Remember about the 16s timer.
            2. Set up an arena in a very specific location.
            3. Resign from a shorter, yet greater 40% Speed boost that Potions of Speed II provide.
    - You can also use this dagger just for the small 7.5% Movement Speed increase and quickly switch to other weapons when needed.

## Trivia
- Zephyr has almost identical stats as a Diamond Sword, with the only difference being its lower durability.
- The word "zephyr" means a soft light breeze.
- Currently, Zephyr does not have an official texture.
