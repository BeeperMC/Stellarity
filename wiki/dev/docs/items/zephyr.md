**Zephyr** is a post-Dragon shortsword that expands movement agility by providing a small speed bonus while held on top of a larger bonus after killing enemies.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i> Zephyr can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Zephyr can be repaired with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-ingot"></i>Iron Ingots.

## Obtaining
Zephyr can be obtained in 2 different ways:
- Crafitng by combining a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-golden-sword"></i>Golden Sword, <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-sword"></i>Iron Sword, 10 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-feather"></i>Feathers and 6 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-sugar"></i>Sugar over [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md). Enchantments from both swords will not be preserved and will be lost.
- Being found in Top Tower Chests inside [End Cities](../structures/end_city.md) with a 14% chance.

## Usage
Holding Zephyr in main hand will give you a passive 10% Movement Speed bonus.

Killing any mob with shortsword will spawn a small wind orb that quickly homes to the player. Once it comes into contact it grants Speed I effect for 33 seconds. The duration increases with each kill, capped at 4 minutes. The additional uptime decreases with duration of your current Speed effect. This stacks with Zephyr's passive speed increase for a grand total of 30% movement speed increase.

## Tips
- Zephyr can be used instead of crafting Swiftness Potions.

## Trivia
- Zephyr has almost identical stats as a Diamond Sword, with the only difference being its lower durability, being a bit higher than an Iron Sword's.
- The word `zephyr` means a soft light breeze.
