## Obtaining
Dragonblade has a 50% chance to drop from the [Ender Dragon](../mobs/bosses/ender_dragon.md). It will have varying stats, forcing players to grind the Dragon for better modifiers.

## Usage
Hitting enemies will inflict so-called *'Dragon Stacks'* on them. The amount of Stacks an enemy has is represented by a growing sphere above their head. After 3 Stacks are inflicted, attacking for the 4th time will also perform a powerful punch that deals 22:heart: x 11 extra damage. It will also inflict huge knockback and push the enemy upwards, resulting in extra fall damage being dealt. The knockback does not work on players due to an in-game limitation, altough it will still severely damage them.

**Knockback Enchantmnet** increases Punch damage by 5:heart: x 1/2 per level, resulting in a max of 32:heart: x 16 damage being dealt with a single punch.

## Tips

- Don't be fooled by its awful stats! The damage of the Punch is enough to make its average DPS higher than any other melee weapon's!
- Dragonblade is VERY slow, meaning that landing accurate hits is the key.
- Spam-clicking the attack button will not work, as you need to deal at least 2:heart: damage in one swing to apply Stacks.
    - This means that it can apply them about 2x faster with damage value of 4, since you only have to wait half the usetime for the damage to be enough.
- Ranged weapons will not apply Dragon Stacks, meaning that direct melee is your only option.
- It is recommended to enchant it as soon as possible with Enchants such as Knockback *(for extra Punch damage)* and Sharpness *(increased base damage means applying Stacks faster)*

## Trivia

- Before it was made obtainable as a 50% drop from the Ender Dragon, Dragonblade was found stuck in the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md)
    - Dragonblade used to be obtainable with commands, but they would return a broken item, meaning that it was truly one-per world.
        - This was patched in 1.5b.
- This item and its ability is based on Kaliyah[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - Its description is also a reference to Kaliyah's original description, `A fearsome warrior with a fiery punch!`
        - The quoted line is a reference to Terraria's S.D.M.G.[^3] tooltip, `It came from the edge of space`

## History

	- Now obtained as a 50% drop from the Ender Dragon, instead of being found stuck in Altar of The Accursed.
