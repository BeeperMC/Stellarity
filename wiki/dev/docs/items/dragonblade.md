## Obtaining
After defeating the Ender Dragon for the very first time, a Dragonblade will spawn, stuck in the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed). It can be picked up by anyone with right-click.

Only one Dragonblade generates on each world, making it the rarest item in the entire datapack.

## Usage
Hitting enemies will inflict *'Dragon Stacks'*. The amount of Stacks an enemy has is represented by a growing sphere above their head. After inflicting 3 Stacks, player can sneak for a moment to trigger a powerful punch. Applied Stacks are reset after 16 seconds.

Punching enemies warps them by 6.6 blocks, facing away from the player. Mobs won't be warped through blocks, stopping on them instead. They will also take 7:heart: х ₃.₅ damage, which is increased to 24:heart: х ₁₂ if punched into a wall. This damage ignores 25% of enemy defense, meaning that higher tier armor and enchantments won't reduce it as much as they would.

Punched enemies will also be stunned for 3 seconds. being completely unable to move. Immobilization doesn't prevent jumping and fall damage.

If an enemy is punched into blocks, neabry enemies will take 4:heart::heart: damage, also with 25% armor penetration.

**Knockback enchantmnet** increases Punch damage. Each level adds 1.5:heart: х ₃ ⁄₄ damage, or 4:heart::heart: if punched into blocks. Wall punch splash damage is increased by the same amount as base punch damage.

Punched mobs cannot be punched for the next 10 seconds, indicated by a cloud of dust above their head.

## Tips
- Don't be fooled by its awful base stats! The damage of the punches is enough to make its average DPS higher than any other end-gane melee weapon's!
- Dragonblade is extremely slow compared to other weapons, meaning that accuracy is of high importance.
- Spam-clicking the attack button will not work, as you need to deal at least 4:heart::heart: damage in one swing to apply Dragon Stacks.
    - This means that enchanting Dragonblade with Sharpness might not be a bad idea, since you will reach the minimum damage requirement quicker.
- Ranged weapons will not apply Dragon Stacks, meaning that direct melee hits are the only option for using it as efficiently as possible.
- <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-ancient-armor"></i> Ancient Chestplate brings its attack speed up to 1.035, meaning that it is slightly quicker than higher tier axes.
- Knockback II <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-dragonblade"></i>Dragonblade deals 32:heart: х ₁₆ damage on punches into blocks. Since it also ignores 1/4th of enemy defense, this means that Netherite Armor fully enchanted with Protection IV still takes around 10:heart::heart::heart::heart::heart: damage.
- As Dragonblade is unbreakable, enchanting it with either Unbreaking or Mending is redundant.

## Trivia
- The methods of obtaining the Dragonblade differed greatly throughout its development.
    - Upon its release in 1.5a, it was found stuck in the Altar of The Accursed, right after entering The End.
        - During the development of 1.6a, it dropped from the Ender Dragon with a 50% chance.
            - After introducing [Crest of The End](trinkets/crest_of_the_end.md), its drop chance was changed to 33%.
            - However due to a community poll, it returned to its one-per-world state, with the only difference being it spawning after defeating the Dragon for the first time, and not prior.
    - Dragonblade can also be obtained with commands, but upon release they would return a broken item instead, meaning that it was truly one-per world.
        - This was patched in 1.5b, with its `/loot give` command functioning as intended.
- This item and its ability is based on Kaliyah[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - Its description is also a reference to Kaliyahkit description - `A fearsome warrior with a fiery punch!`.
    - The quoted line is a reference to Terraria's S.D.M.G.[^3] tooltip, `It came from the edge of space`.
- Prior to 1.6a, it acted as an indirect upgrade to a Netherite Sword, with its special mechanic being spawning clouds of Dragon's Breath on hits and increasing damage temporarily after that.
- During the development of 1.6a, it went through a total of 3 reworks.
    - First one was simply editing the Dragon's Breath cloud properties and damage increase.
    - Second one was similair to current behavior, but the punch damage was always 22 and it also had upward motion. It also triggered on 4th hit, rather than when sneaking.
    - Third one is the current verion.
- Dying to a Dragonblade's punch in PvP will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM was punched into the otherworld by PLAYER`.
