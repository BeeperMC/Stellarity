## Obtaining
Ancient Wooden Sword can be obtained by exhuming <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-wooden-sword"></i>Wooden Sword at an [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md). Result item will keep all enchantments of exhumed weapon.

## Usage
This weapon has infinite Attack Speed attribute, meaning that it can be spam clicked in order to attack. Additionally, every swing will result in a sweep attack.

Due to its high speed, it has a base damage of only 4:heart::heart:, meaning that **Sharpness Enchantment** is a necessity in order to get respectable DPS.
## Tips

- This weapon is excellent for crowd control due to every attack having a sweep.
    - It is also fantastic for people who are a bit worse in PvP and PvE due to attack speed being enough to forgive poor hit accuracy.
- Ancient Wooden Sword is unreakable, meaning that enchants such as Unbreaking and Mending are completely redundant.
- Even tho it has really high attack speed, there are some way better options at this point in game DPS-wise, like the [Dragonblade](dragonblade.md), or even [Spirit Daggers](spirit_dagger.md).
    - An enchanted <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-sword"></i>Diamond Sword is propably enough to perform better than this weapon. 
  
## Trivia

- The texture used for this weapon is its original pre-1.14 Programmer Art texture.
- The tooltip is FokaStudio laughing at everyone who prefers 1.8 combat, <u>but can't justify why 1.9 one is bad</u>.
    - It is also a play on his opinion that 1.8 combat revolved around `outright destroying one's left mouse button`.
