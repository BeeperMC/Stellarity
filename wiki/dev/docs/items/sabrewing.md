## Obtaining
Sabrewing can be crafted at an [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) by combining a regular <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-bow"></i>Bow, 10 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-feather"></i>Feathers, 12 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-gold-ingot"></i>Gold Ingots and a single <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-ingot
"></i>Netherite Bar. The enchantments from the <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-bow"></i>Bow used to craft it will be transferred.

## Usage
With Sabrewing, players can choose to supercharge their shot by drawing it for a total of 3 seconds. Supercharging will directly increase arrow velocity and damage by 33% and will also treat the bow as having 3 extra levels of Power enchantment. This means that supercharging an unenchanted Sabrewing will make arrows deal a 1/3 more damage than ones shot from a Power III Bow.

While charging Sabrewing, players move 25% slower. This effect goes away after 

## Tips
- Stay at a safe distance and try to snipe all the targets. Due to its longer draw time, it is discouraged to use it in closer range battles.

## Trivia
- This item is based on Sabrewing from Minecraft: Dungeons.
    - Surprisingly, its special ability isn't based on the weapon itself, but on an Enchant from this game - Dynamo.
- Its tooltip is a reference to the fact that it has the ability to one shot almost everything with correct damage setup
    - It is also a reference to FokaStudio's initial testing, where the item dealt about a 1000 damage per shot due to an oversight.
- This items used to function differently some time during the development of 1.6a.
    - Its draw time used to be 15 seconds, and it applied a rising damage multiplier which scaled with it. Max multiplier was 9x.
        - This was changed as Sabrewing's DPS was far smaller than any other end-game ranged weapon's.
