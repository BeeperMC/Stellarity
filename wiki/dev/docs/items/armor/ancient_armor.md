## Obtaining
Pieces of Ancient Armor have a 33% chance to generate in any Chest found inside [End Cities](../../structures/end_city.md), except for the ones on Ships. It has an additional 36% chance to have random enchantments.

## Set Bonus

Wearing full set of Ancient Armor will grant the wearer a 30% damage boost to <u>Sword, Crossbow and Bow</u> damage. This boost stacks with default 20% boost from just armor pieces for a total of 50% increased damage.

Aditionally, running with a full set of Ancient Armor will produce a trail. It serves no purpose other than bein a neat little visual effect.

## Tips

- This armor set pairs extremely well with:
    - <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-sabrewing"></i>[Sabrewing](../sabrewing.md) - Supercharged shots can reach up to **60:heart: x 30 damage**, and even up to **150:heart: x 75** with Power enchantment.
    - <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-ancient-wooden-sword"></i>[Ancient Wooden Sword](../ancient_wooden_sword.md) - with Sharpness V, it can deal 10.5:heart: x 5 1/4 damage per swing, which will make this weapon's single target DPS comparable to the one of a Sharpness V Netherite Sword *(without Ancient Armor)* 
    - <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-sariel"></i>[Sariel](../sariel.md) - Sariel already has a quick attack speed. Paired with Ancient Armor, its swing cooldown will be reduced to just 0.25 seconds, meaning that you can land more hits *(which equals to increased heal chance)*
    - <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-dragonblade"></i>[Dragonblade](../dragonblade.md) - Ancient Armor almost doubles its attack speed, which is very needed due to how slow it is. This effectively allows for quicker and more reliable application of Stacks.

## Trivia

- Ancient Armor, [Hallowed](hallowed_armor.md) Armor and [Living Flesh](../living_flesh.md) were one of the first items to have ever been added into FSEE.
    - The first ever items to be added are [Treasure Heads](../../mechanics/treasure_heads.md)
    - While it got added as far back as 1.3a, Living Flesh had no use before 1.5a.
- Prior to 1.5a, this armor set was known as `Ancient Diamond Armor`.
    - It also used to have random stats. It could provide a random amount of Defense, Attack Speed, Attack Knockback and Movement Speed.
        - Due to how Attack Knockback works in Minecraft, it didn't increase anything.
        - Movement Speed increase was so huge that players could trigger vanilla anti-cheat in Singleplayer while wearing 2 or more armor pieces.

## History
- **1.6a**
	- Fixed Ancient Leggings being a piece of Diamond Armor *(1.5a rework leftover)*
	- Now has a custom texture.
	- Set bonus damage reduced *(+50% -> +30%, for a 50% total instead of 70%)*
	- Each piece gained 0.3 Armor Toughness, for a total of 2. This puts Ancient Armor on par with Diamond Armor defense-wise
	- Only Ancient Scalemail grants Attack Speed bonus. Bonus decreased *(+60% -> + 40%)*
	- Nerfed quality of enchantments of armor pieces found in Chests.
	- Chests in End Cities have a 66% chance to contain an Armor piece, of which there is a 50/50 chance it is going to be a piece of Ancient Armor. Previously, it would be Ancient Armor piece 3/4 of the time.

- **1.5a**
	- Reworked entire set. It no longer has randomized stats and instead focuses on increasing offensive capabilites.
	- Added a full set bonus.
	- Turned into a dyed Leather Armor with custom durability, instead of using Diamond Armor.
	- Added a trail while moving around with full set.

- **1.3a**
	- Introduced.
