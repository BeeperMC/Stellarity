<div markdown class="foka-infobox-text">
**Shulker Armor** is a post-Dragon armor set that is a direct upgrade of <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-chestplate"></i>Netherite Armor, focusing on making wearer as tanky as possible.

Full set grants full knockback immunity, as well as a flat 20% damage reduction and immunity to Levitation and Wither debuffs.

## Obtaining
Each piece of Shulker Armor can be crafted by combining any piece of <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-chestplate"></i>Netherite Armor with 8 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-shulker-shell"></i>Shulker Shells over an [Altar of The Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md). Enchantments from the armor piece used to craft it will be transfered in the process, however things like custom name or attributes will be lost.

## Set Bonus
While equipped with full set of Shulker Armor being damaged will result in up to 3 Shulker Bullets being spawned. They will automatically seek out nearby enemies, dealing 4:heart::heart: damage, as well as applying Levitation for 10 seconds for extra fall damage. Wearer will also become immune to Levitation and Wither debuffs.

Set bonus also applies permanent Resistance I, which is equal to flat 20% damage reduction.

## Tips

- It won't remove Levitation given to players after being saved from falling into the Void by a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-totem-of-undying"></i>Totem of Undying.
- Movement Speed decrease can be countered by using a <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-duskberry"></i>[Duskberry](../trinkets/duskberry.md), however it might be difficult to find one.
    - Alternatively, Swiftness Potions might act as a temporar solution.
- [Endurance Potions](../other/potions.md#endurance_potion) become redundant due to set bonus giving Resistance status effect instead of directly reducing damage taken by 1/5th.

## Trivia

- This is the third set to be added into FSEE, 4 months after <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-ancient-armor"></i>[Ancient Armor](ancient_armor.md) and <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-hallowed-armor"></i>[Hallowed Armor](hallowed_armor.md).
- The only reason why Levitation immunity was incorporated into the set bonus was because *(very rarely)* Shulker Bullets which were spawned on damage could hit player, levitating them upewards, which felt rather awkward.
    - This was patched in 1.6a, however Levitation immunity still stayed.
    - This was later expanded to also provide immunity to Wither debuff.
- This armor set acts as an alternative to so-called `Enderite Armor`, since FokaStudio didn't want to add an all-in-one armor set with a generic recipe that requires just gathering some End ore.
