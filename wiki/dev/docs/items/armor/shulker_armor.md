## Obtaining
Each piece of Shulker Armor can be crafted by combining any piece of <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-chestplate"></i>Netherite Armor with 16 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-shulker-shell"></i>Shulker Shells over an [Altar of The Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md)

## Set Bonus

While equipped with full Shulker Armor, after being hit, up to 3 Shulker Bullets will be spawned. They will automatically seek out nearby enemies, dealing 4:heart::heart: damage as well as applying Levitation for 10 seconds. Wearer will also become immune to Levitation debuff.

Set bonus also applies permanent Resistance II, which is equal to guaranteed 20% damage reduction.

### Comparison between Shulker and Netherite Armor
| X | Netherite Armor | Shulker Armor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total Defense | 20 + 12 Armor Toughness | 20 + 16 Armor Toughness |
| Obtainable After | Entering the Nether | Finding an End City |
| Has Set Bonus | :x: | :white_check_mark: |
| Flat Damage Reduction | :x: | 20% *(with Set Bonus)* |
| Knockback Resistance | 40% | 100% |
| Drawbacks | :x: | Reduced damage, attack speed and agility |

## Tips

- It won't remove Levitation given to players after falling into the Void.
- Damage and Movement Speed decreases can be countered by using a [Duskberry](../trinkets/duskberry.md), but it is hard to find.
- [Endurance Potions](../other/potions.md#endurance_potion) are redundant due to set bonus giving Resistance status effect instead of directly reducing damage taken by 1/5th.

## Trivia

- This is the third set to be added into FSEE, 4 months after [Ancient Armor](ancient_armor.md) and [Hallowed Armor](hallowed_armor.md).
- The only reason FokaStudio added Levitation immunity into the set bonus was because very rarely Shulker Bullets spawned when hit could hit player, which felt rather awkward.
- This armor set is an alternative to `Enderite Armor`, since FokaStudio didn't want to add an all-in-one armor set with a generic recipe that requires just gathering some ores.
