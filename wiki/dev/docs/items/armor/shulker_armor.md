## Obtaining
Each piece of Shulker Armor can be crafted by combining any piece of <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-chestplate"></i>Netherite Armor with 16 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-shulker-shell"></i>Shulker Shells over an [Altar of The Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md)

## Set Bonus

While equipped with full set of Shulker Armor being damaged will result in up to 3 Shulker Bullets being spawned. They will automatically seek out nearby enemies, dealing 4:heart::heart: damage, as well as applying Levitation for 10 seconds for extra fall damage. Wearer will also become immune to Levitation debuff.

Set bonus also applies permanent Resistance I, which is equal to flat 20% damage reduction.

### Comparison between Shulker and Netherite Armor

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total Defense | 20 + 12 Armor Toughness | 20 + 16 Armor Toughness |
| Obtainable After | Entering the Nether | Finding an End City |
| Has Set Bonus | :x: | :white_check_mark: |

| Knockback Resistance | 40% | 100% |
| Drawbacks | :x: | Reduced damage, attack speed and agility |

## Tips

- It won't remove Levitation given to players after falling into the Void.
- Damage and Movement Speed decreases can be countered by using a <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-duskberry"></i>[Duskberry](../trinkets/duskberry.md), but it is hard to find.
- [Endurance Potions](../other/potions.md#endurance_potion) are redundant due to set bonus giving Resistance status effect instead of directly reducing damage taken by 1/5th.

## Trivia

- This is the third set to be added into FSEE, 4 months after <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-ancient-armor"></i>[Ancient Armor](ancient_armor.md) and <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-hallowed-armor"></i>[Hallowed Armor](hallowed_armor.md).
- The only reason why Levitation immunity was incorporated into the set bonus was because *(very rarely)* Shulker Bullets which were spawned on damage could hit player, levitating them upewards, which felt rather awkward.
- This armor set is an alternative to `Enderite Armor`, since FokaStudio didn't want to add an all-in-one armor set with a generic recipe that requires just gathering some ores.
