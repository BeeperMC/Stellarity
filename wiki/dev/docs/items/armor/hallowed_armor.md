# Hallowed Armor
<div class="result foka-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="foka-infobox-text">
**Hallowed Armor** is a post-Dragon armor set obtained from Treasure Chests in End Cities that provides a tiny bit less defense than <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-chestplate"></i>Diamond Armor, but instead boosts one's movement speed and provides a bit of Knockback Resistance.

Full set bonus allows for dodging attacks, completely nullifying their damage and knockback. Dodging will also make player completely invulnerable for a few seconds.

## Obtaining
Pieces of Hallowed Armor have a 33% chance to generate in any Chest found inside [End Cities](../../structures/end_city.md), except for the ones on Ships. It has an additional 36% chance to have random enchantments.

## Set Bonus

Equipping full set of Hallowed armor will start a 20 seconds countdown. After reaching 0, player will get a buff - **Holy Protection**. Upon taking <u>ANY</u> damage, Holy Protection will set all incoming damage to 0 for next 5 seconds, as well as making player immune to all forms of knockback. Additionally, player will get Fire Protection and Water Breathing for next 8 seconds, as well as a short boost to Movement Speed that decays over timespan of 6 seconds.

This dodge has a cooldown of another 16 seconds. The initial 20 seconds is reapplied only when player takes off Hallowed Armor.

## Tips

- This armor is incredibly versatile, as it can be paired with any weapon or trinket.
- Combining Hallowed Armor with [Duskberry](../trinkets/duskberry.md) and a Swiftness Potion is a fantastic strategy for the [Empress of Light](../../mobs/bosses/empress_of_light.md), making players able to outrun most of her attacks as well as providing them a second change if they fail to dodge them.

## Trivia

- <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-ancient-armor"></i>[Ancient Armor](ancient_armor.md), <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-hallowed-armor"></i>Hallowed Armor and <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-living-flesh"></i>[Living Flesh](../other/living_flesh.md) were the first items to have ever been added into FSEE.
    - The first ever items to be added are [Treasure Heads](../../mechanics/treasure_heads.md)
    - While it got added as far back as 1.3a, <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-living-flesh"></i>Living Flesh had no use before 1.5a.
        - However, it was officialy removed as of 1.6a.
- Prior to 1.5a, this armor set was known as <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-chestplate"></i>`Hallowed Diamond Armor`.
    - It also used to have random stats. It could provide a random amount of Defense, Attack Speed, Armor Toughness and Movement Speed.
        - Movement Speed increase was so huge that players could trigger vanilla anti-cheat in Singleplayer while wearing 2 or more armor pieces.
        - Sometimes Armor Toughness would get listed twice due to some errors in loot tables. 
            - This has since been fixed.
- When resource pack is enabled, golden parts of Hallowed Armor produce a faint glow in the dark.
- During the development of 1.6a, Holy Protection used to timeout after 15 seconds without being damaged, altough it was removed a few weeks later.
    - The official reason was because FokaStudio couldn't stand the constant '`Holy Protection ON and OFF`' sounds.
