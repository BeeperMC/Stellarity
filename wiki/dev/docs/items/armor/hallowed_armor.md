# Hallowed Armor
<div class="result foka-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="foka-infobox-text">
**Hallowed Armor** is a post-Dragon armor set obtained from Treasure Chests in End Cities that provides a tiny bit less defense than <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-chestplate"></i>Diamond Armor, but instead gives the ability to periodically dodge incoming attacks, nullifying all damage as well as all knockback.</div>

## Obtaining
Pieces of Hallowed Armor have a 33% chance to generate in any Chest found inside [End Cities](../../structures/end_city.md), except for the ones on Ships. It has an additional 36% chance to have random enchantments.

## Set Bonus

Equipping full set of Hallowed armor will start a 20 seconds countdown. After reaching 0, player will get a buff - **Holy Protection**. Upon taking <u>ANY</u> damage, Holy Protection will set all incoming damage to 0 for next 5 seconds, as well as making player immune to all forms of knockback. Additionaly, player will get Fire Protection and Water Breathing for next 8 seconds, as well as a short boost to Movement Speed that decays over timespan of 6 seconds.

This dodge has a cooldown of another 16 seconds. The initial 20 seconds is reapplied only when players takes off Hallowed Armor.

If the dodge is not used in 15 seconds after starting Holy Protection, it will time out and require waiting another 16 seconds

## Tips

- This armor is incredibly versatile, as it can be paired with any weapon or trinket.
- Combining Hallowed Armor with [Duskberry](../trinkets/duskberry.md) and a Swiftness Potion is a fantastic strategy for the [Empress of Light](../../mobs/bosses/empress_of_light.md), making players able to outrun most of her attacks as well as providing them with a reliable way to dodge her dashes. 

## Trivia

- [Ancient Armor](ancient_armor.md), Hallowed Armor and [Living Flesh](../living_flesh.md) were the first items to have ever been added into FSEE.
    - The first ever items to be added are [Treasure Heads](../../mechanics/treasure_heads.md)
    - While it got added as far back as 1.3a, Living Flesh had no use before 1.5a.
- Prior to 1.5a, this armor set was known as `Hallowed Diamond Armor`.
    - It also used to have random stats. It could provide a random amount of Defense, Attack Speed, Armor Toughness and Movement Speed.
        - Movement Speed increase was so huge that players could trigger vanilla anti-cheat in Singleplayer while wearing 2 or more armor pieces.
        - Sometimes Armor Toughness would get listed twice due to some errors in loot tables. 
            - This has since been fixed.
- When resource pack is enabled, golden parts of Hallowed Armor will glow in the dark.
- Hallowed Armor was the most tweaked item in 1.6a that didn't receive a major rework.

## History
- **1.6a**
	- Now has a custom texture.
	- Each piece gained 0.5 Armor Toughness, for a total of 1.5. This puts Hallowed Armor slightly before Diamond Armor defense-wise
	- Fixed Holy Protection cooldown being 3 - 4 seconds shorter than usual because of it starting before invincibility.
	- Holy Protection duration increased (3 seconds -> 4 seconds)
	- Holy Protection Fire Resistance duration increased (3 seconds -> 7 seconds)
	- Holy Protection now also grants 7 seconds of Water Breathing.
	- Holy Protection Speed boost now lasts longer (4 -> 6 seconds) and diminishes over time.
	- Only Hallowed Treads now provide Movement Speed bonus (12% -> 10% boost)
	- Each Hallowed Armor piece no longer provides extra 7.5%:heart:HP. It instead grants 20% reduced taken knockback.
	- Fixed Holy Protection invincibility being removable with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-milk-bucket"></i>Milk.
	- Nerfed quality of enchantments of armor pieces found in Chests.
	- Chests in End Cities have a 66% chance to contain an Armor piece, of which there is a 50/50 chance it is going to be a piece of Hallowed Armor. Previously, it would be a Hallowed Armor piece 1/4 of the time.

- **1.5a**
	- Reworked entire set. It no longer has randomized stats and instead grants the ability to dodge attacks.
	- Added a full set bonus.
	- Turned into a dyed Leather Armor with custom durability, instead of using Diamond Armor.

- **1.3a**
	- Introduced.
