**FokaStudio's Ender Expansion is a datapack that completely rehauls The End dimension in a way that is both spectacular and unique. And most notably - not dead and barren,**

FSEE has started as a direct port of [Far End](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/far-end-ender-expansion-datapack-v0-1/). Hex stated they do not have enough time to update the pack + some features were not possible back then, like island generation.

*AND THEN I APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE LIKE A NEW POKEMON OF SOME SORT, AND DID THE IMPOSSIBLE!*

**And here we are today!** The pack is nothing like old Far End, not even one file was left untouched!

!!! note "What is in the pack as of right now"

    - 17 new biomes + complete revamp of 5 vanilla ones
    - 3 new armor sets
    - 3 new weapons
    - 1 new mob, but these numbers will grow soon
    - A handful of QOL features, like Endemites having a chance to drop back your Ender Pearl! Or Allays spawning naturally in The Hallow biome
    - A couple new structures that generate all over The End
    - Massive overhaul to the shape of End Islands. No more ugly isles on one Y level :sunglasses:
    - Completely revamped End Cities
    - Completely revamped Strongholds, which is something most packs do not really change.
    - Full Multiplayer compatibility! It is actually more fun to play this with friends and conquer The End together!
