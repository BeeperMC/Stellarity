The biome tends to generate on hilly, continental terrain, although it rarely generates on forms of terrain that are a bit more shattered. It is one of a few biomes where End Villages can be found.

Usage \u00b6 Upon shooting, Prismatic Punch will transform any Arrow into a powerful Prismatic Blast. They are slow and deccelerate over time until stopping completely. After stopping they will linger in place for about 15 more second until they self-detonate. Prismatic Blasts gain a huge speed bonus when an enemy is nearby, which they will target and home onto, detonating on contact.

Tips \u00b6 Use regular Arrows with this weapon, since it converts ALL ammo into Blasts. Using Spectral/Tipped Arrows is a waste of ammo. Explosions can hurt you if you stand too close to your target. Keep your distance. Accuracy is not the most important thing, since Blasts will home on its targets. Be careful though, as Blasts tend to target different mobs than the ones you want! Prismatic Blasts do not home onto players in PvP, but they can still hurt them.

Tips \u00b6 Sniping targets from safe distance is the best way to use this Bow due to how vulnerable it leaves you while supercharging. It is recommended to enchant this weapon first and then use it, due to the fact that with Power V, Sabrewing will almost double (and sometimes triple) its damage. Using it against Bosses is useful for slowly removing big chunks of their health. Do note that bosses like the Ender Dragon and the Empress of Light take reduced damage from all Arrows, meaning that Sabrewing's will perform a bit worse than on other enemies. This bow has surprisingly high durability. Enchanting it with Mending might be redundant due to its slow fire rate (therefore low durability usage) Sabrewing is fantastic for PvP, being able to one shot all but the tankiest players. The only way to reliably survive a supercharged shot is to use Hallowed Armor 's Holy Protection to completely negate all damage. Additionaly, having all armor pieces enchanted with Projectile Protection IV is enough to reduce damage of a max charged Power V shot to just a couple of hearts.
