It can be picked up by anyone with right-click. Only one Dragonblade generates on each world, making it the rarest item in the entire datapack. Usage \u00b6 Hitting enemies will inflict 'Dragon Stacks' . The amount of Stacks an enemy has is represented by a growing sphere above their head. After inflicting 3 Stacks, player can sneak for a moment to trigger a powerful punch. Applied Stacks are reset after 16 seconds. Punching enemies warps them by 6.6 blocks, facing away from the player. Mobs won't be warped through blocks, stopping on them instead. They will also take 7 \u0445 \u2083.\u2085 damage, which is increased to 24 \u0445 \u2081\u2082 if punched into a wall. This damage ignores 25% of enemy defense, meaning that higher tier armor and enchantments won't reduce it as much as they would. Punched enemies will also be stunned for 3 seconds. being completely unable to move. Immobilization doesn't prevent jumping and fall damage. They are also afflicted with Weakness I for 7 seconds. If an enemy is punched into blocks, neabry enemies will take 4 damage, also with 25% armor penetration. Knockback enchantmnet increases Punch damage. Each level adds 1.5 \u0445 \u2083 \u2044\u2084 damage, or 4 if punched into blocks. Wall punch splash damage is increased by the same amount as base punch damage. Punched mobs cannot be punched for the next 8.5 seconds, indicated by a cloud of dust above their head. Tips \u00b6 Don't be fooled by its awful base stats! The damage of the punches is enough to make its average DPS higher than any other end-gane melee weapon's! Dragonblade is extremely slow compared to other weapons, meaning that accuracy is of high importance. Spam-clicking the attack button will not work, as you need to deal at least 4 damage in one swing to apply Dragon Stacks. This means that enchanting Dragonblade with Sharpness might not be a bad idea, since you will reach the minimum damage requirement quicker. Ranged weapons will not apply Dragon Stacks, meaning that direct melee hits are the only option for using it as efficiently as possible. Ancient Chestplate brings its attack speed up to 1.035, meaning that it is slightly quicker than higher tier axes. Knockback II Dragonblade deals 32 \u0445 \u2081\u2086 damage on punches into blocks. Since it also ignores \u00bcth of enemy defense, this means that Netherite Armor fully enchanted with Protection IV still takes around 10 damage. As Dragonblade is unbreakable, enchanting it with either Unbreaking or Mending is redundant. Trivia \u00b6 The methods of obtaining the Dragonblade differed greatly throughout its development. Upon its release in 1.5a, it was found stuck in the Altar of The Accursed, right after entering The End. During the development of 1.6a, it dropped from the Ender Dragon with a 50% chance. After introducing Crest of The End , its drop chance was changed to 33%. However due to a community poll, it returned to its one-per-world state, with the only difference being it spawning after defeating the Dragon for the first time, and not prior.

The damage of the punches is enough to make its average DPS higher than any other end-gane melee weapon's! Dragonblade is extremely slow compared to other weapons, meaning that accuracy is of high importance. Spam-clicking the attack button will not work, as you need to deal at least 4 damage in one swing to apply Dragon Stacks. This means that enchanting Dragonblade with Sharpness might not be a bad idea, since you will reach the minimum damage requirement quicker. Ranged weapons will not apply Dragon Stacks, meaning that direct melee hits are the only option for using it as efficiently as possible. Ancient Chestplate brings its attack speed up to 1.035, meaning that it is slightly quicker than higher tier axes. Knockback II Dragonblade deals 32 \u0445 \u2081\u2086 damage on punches into blocks.

Explosions can hurt you if you stand too close to your target. Keep your distance. Accuracy is not the most important thing, since Blasts will home on its targets.

Consume them to instantly teleport and gain buffs for short duration. Info Damage 4.5 Attack Speed Fast (1.9) Tooltip Holding one can attract Spirits on attacks Holding one in both left and right hand will allow you to consume said Spirits Consume Spirits to instantly teleport and gain a short attack buff 'yes, I like roblox, okay?' Developer Item Durability 496 Obtaining \u00b6 Spirit Dagger has a 10% chance to drop from Phantoms found anywhere in The End . It won't drop in any other dimension. Looting enchantment increases the drop chance by 1% per level, for a maximum of 13% drop chance with Looting III. Spirit Dagger also has a very low chance to drop from Endermen found anywhere in The End as well, having a 1% base drop chance that is increased by 1% with every level of Looting, for a maximum drop chance of 4%. Usage \u00b6 Attracted Spirit Spirit Dagger is pretty unique in terms of usage. When using only one, damaging enemies has a 50% chance to attract Spirits, but you won't be able to use them for anything unless you are holding 2 Spirit Daggers - one in your main hand, and one in your offhand. There can exist only one Spirit in a 6 block radius. Having both equipped will allow you to consume said Spirits by focusing on them for 7 ticks. Your consumption progress will be shown in your action bar. Consuming Spirits will instantly teleport you to their location. Teleportation will create a large area slash that will damage all enemies around you for 4 damage with 50% armor penetration. After that you will receive a small combat buff in form of 4 points of temporar Absorption, extra 4.5 \u0445 \u2082.\u2082\u2085 damage, 40% extra movement speed and 10% extra attack speed. All these buffs last for 5 seconds. Attacked mobs that have attracted a Spirit won't be able to do it again for the next 17 seconds, indicated by colorful particles above their head. Tips \u00b6 Spirits can be attracted by ANY damage, including (but not limited to) other Swords, Crossbows, Bows, etc., for as long as you are holding a Spirit Dagger in any hand. a However, the damage dealt has to be higher than 3 \u0445 \u2081.\u2085. Anything lower than that will simply not work. Teleporting has a distance limit of 70 blocks , meaning that you could potentialy attract a Spirit by shooting an enemy with a Bow and teleport a great range. Spyglass comes in handy in this scenario, since you can easily position your cursor on a Spirit and then switch to a Spirit Dagger in order to consume it. To fully use this weapon you have to obtain 2 of them. Using a weapon enchanted with Looting III is heavily encouraged due to how uncommon Phantoms are in The End. Despite the drop chance being relatively low, this item can be easily obtained in great quantities by opening multiple Pandora's Barrels . Be careful though, as Pandora's Barrel also increases stats of spawned mobs. Slash attack won't deal any knockback, so you might still get damaged by mobs after teleporting. Luckily, the 4 Absorption should be enough to tank at least part of the contact damage. This item pairs extremely well with Sharanga , since Arrows shot from are unaffected by gravity, meaning that it is easier to snipe targets from far away in order to potentially attract Spirits. Trivia \u00b6 This is the second Developer weapon to get added into FSEE, the first being Prismatic Punch . This weapon is based on Spirit Daggers - a weapon used by Evelynn 1 in Roblox BedWars 2 . This is also a reference to the fact that FokaStudio loves this game and plays it far more often than he is coding. This item had a total of 3 different drop chances prior to official release. It first started with 12.5% base chance with 2.5% Looting bonus, then 15%/+3.5% before being nerfed to 10%/+1%, which stayed to this date.

Prior to 1.5a, this armor set was known as Hallowed Diamond Armor . It also used to have random stats. It could provide a random amount of Defense, Attack Speed, Armor Toughness and Movement Speed. Movement Speed increase was so huge that players could trigger vanilla anti-cheat in Singleplayer while wearing 2 or more armor pieces. Sometimes Armor Toughness would get listed twice due to some errors in loot tables. This has since been fixed. When resource pack is enabled, golden parts of Hallowed Armor produce a faint glow in the dark. During the development of 1.6a, Holy Protection used to timeout after 15 seconds without being damaged, altough it was removed a few weeks later.
