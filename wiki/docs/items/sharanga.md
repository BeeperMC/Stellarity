## Obtaining
Sharanga has a chance to drop from Illusioners in [Strongholds](../structures/stronghold.md) with a 9% base chance. Each level of Looting increases the odds by 3%, up to a total of 18% with Looting III.
Usage
Unless Spectral Arrows are used as ammunition for this Bow, it has no special properties other than reduced durability.

When firing Spectral Arrows though, they are converted into high velocity Spectral Bolts. Spectral Bolts can pierce through 20 enemies, inflicting 10 seconds of Glowing, while moving at 1.5x the velocity of standard Arrows.

Spectral Bolts also explode after hitting a block, or after 1.5 seconds passes. The explosion deals 66% of base arrow damage, ignoring 100% of enemy's armor. It does not increase with pull time. Explosions also inflict Glowing for 10 seconds, just like Bolts themselves.

## Tips
- Due to how Arrow damage works in Minecraft, Sharanga actually deals 1.5x damage a regular Bow would do.
- Because of how rounding works Spectral Bolts' Explosion deals between 2.3 - 2.7 damage for Power levels 2 and 3, and not full 3.
- The armor-ignoring properties of Spectral Explosion do not work in PvP.
- This bow can deal up to 21 damage with Power V. This is balanced with with short range.
- Arrows will always disappear after 1.5 seconds, not after travelling a set distance.
- Sharanga has reduced durability compared to regular bows, so enchant it with Unbreaking (and/or Mending) as soon as possible to use it for as long as possible!

## Trivia
- This is the first ranged weapon to ever be added into FSEE.
- Prior to 1.6a, Explosions would respect armor and deal set 10 damage to all enemies. This has been changed since then.
- Endermen don't teleport when hit with Spectral Explosion, but will if hit with Spectral Bolts. 

## History
- **1.6a**
	- Sharanga drops a bit more frequently (5% base chance -> 9%,  with 2% -> 3% extra chance from Looting)
	- Spectral Explosions no longer deal set 11 damage, and instead deal 66% of Arrow's base damage with 100% armor penetration.
	- Spectral Bolts velocity buffed (1x -> 1.5x). This also increases damage output.
	- Optimized and cleaned up Sharanga's Arrow conversion code.
	- Sharanga durability nerfed (384 -> 294)
- **1.5b**
	- Introduced
