## Obtaining
Sariel can be crafted at an [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) by combining an <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-sword"></i>Iron Sword, <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-wither-skeleton-skull"></i>Wither Skeleton Skull and 10 [Pixie Dust](pixie_dust.md), meaning that in order to craft it, the player has to venture into [The Hallow](../biomes/the_hallow.md) first.

## Usage
After attacking any mob, there is a 20% chance that a Healing Orb will spawn, slowly flying towards the nearest player while accelerating slighly. After coming into contact with one, player will be healed by 4:heart::heart: HP. Up to 3 Healing Orbs can be spawned at once.

| Number of Healing Orbs | Chance |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 20% |
| 2 | 4% |
| 3 | 0.08% |

This item pairs extremely well with ranged weapons. Equip any Bow/Crossbow in your offhand and Sariel in your mainhand. Shooting an enemy has a chance to spawn healing orbs as well, altough at a reduced chance.

| Number of Healing Orbs spawned while attacking form a distance | Chance |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 3% |
| 2 | 0.09% |
| 3 | 0.0027% |

## Tips

- Due to Sariel's low damage, it is heavily discouraged to use it as ones primary weapon, and instead use it alongside another weapon of choice.
- Sariel's quick attack speed can be utilized to heal large portions of lost HP when attacking in a quick succesion.
- Sariel does work with ranged weapons, but the Healing Orb spawn chance is so small that it is practically a waste of offhand slot, which could be used to equip a more useful [Trinket](trinkets/index.md) instead.

## Trivia

- Sariel will not spawn any Healing Orbs if damage done in a single hit is lower than 3. This is in order to prevent spam clicking to heal massive amounts of HP.
- Its name is a reference to [Sariel](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Sariel) - a charcater from Touhou Project game series.
  - Despite Sariel being a Death Angle in Touhou, the item itself deals very little damage and focuses on healing instead.
  - Its tooltip is a reference to [Sariel's first theme](https://youtu.be/YiN9rqnxw20), that has the exact same title.
  - Sariels are also archangels, mainly from Judaic tradition.
- Sariels Durability value - 777 - is a number associated with getting divine guidance.
- Healing Orbs move  a bit slower than player's running speed, but a bit faster than their walking speed.
- Sariels has went through a total of 4 healing chance changes, from 18% -> 27% -> 22% -> 33% -> 20%.
  - Its ranged healing capabilities have went through a total of 3 such changes, from 22% -> 7% -> 5% (unreleased) -> 3%.
- On initial item release, Healing Orbs would always move at set speed. It wasn't until over a month later when they have been nerfed.
	- Same applies to triggering healing via ranged weapons.
